Phase 1: normalizer.h



Why: "Normalizing" data is a standard CS term. You are taking weird input (Trigraphs) and standardizing it.

Phase 2: splicer.h



Why: "Splicing" is the exact term used in the C standard for joining lines. It sounds precise and mechanical.

Phase 3: tokenizer.h (or lexer.h)



Why: The standard term. tokenizer sounds a bit more substantial than lexer.

Phase 4: expander.h



Why: This phase is primarily about macro expansion. It describes exactly what the code is doing to the stream.

Phase 5: converter.h



Why: You are converting from the Source Character Set to the Execution Character Set.

Phase 6: concatenator.h



Why: A bit of a mouthful, but it is the mathematically correct term for joining strings.

Phase 7: parser.h



Why: The classic, undeniable name for the final stage.
